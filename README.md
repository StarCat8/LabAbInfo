Esercizio Abilit√† Info 2022\23

 The python code has embedded a little bash command to extract the data tarball. It is required to the user to give the full path to the .tgz archive and its name, then another directory path where to be extracted.
The code should then run without further actions required from the users.
It should produce a total of 9 plots, 3 for each measurment's set.
The first plot of the three will be a composite matrix of the submatrices built upon the covariance matrices of the data from the measurments.
The second plot will be the same composite matrix this time built upon the theoretical covariance matrices.
The third plot will be a plot of the residuals.

The source has been compiled and ran on a win10 machine during the development (using the needed bash extensions) and has been tested on another windows machine and on a ubuntu (last release at the time of the commit) machine.

 Hope this is right!
